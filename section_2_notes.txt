I am not using react 16 as I didn't want to downgrade so I am using an alternative enzyme adapter

Her formatting makes my eyes bleed

I am not sure I agree with not using 'id' or 'class' in favor of data-test.  The behavior I think is part of the component and if that component's name is changed we should be asking why?
    Is the component serving a different purpose, we should make a new name....
    If the component is being replaced by a new component we should be expecting that id.
    If we are making this current component contain another should we really be changing the test name targets while that other component should also have a similar level of testing

    now I do like the idea of 'data-test' as a name but this is now another tag that "developers" need to maintain in functional code internal documentation
        Where as the code and tests could be doing this with clean maintenance of the tags that should be in use already


Yes babel remove properties is great but if an app can keep it's attributes well maintained that is one less package you could be having to add
